# Post Booking Manager

Build a post-booking manager application which will show all the bookings done using the Orxe platform. Below are some requirement –

 

The first screen will be a login screen. You can use any authentication integration like AuthO or any third-party integration like Gmail etc.
Once login user will see the list of trips that use have booked through the Orxe Platform. Preferably integrate it will our trips service to fetch the data, but if not, you can mock the data behind the service.
When the user clicks on any of the trips, the details screen will show more details about bookings.
From the details, the screen user can do some post-booking operations like Cancellation, Flight Status, etc.
Application should have 100% code coverage.
 

You can extend/enhance and innovate the application according to your imagination.  Take reference from Google Trips or any other application in the market.
